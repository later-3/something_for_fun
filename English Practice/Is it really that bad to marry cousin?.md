1. 有些事情我们认为是显而易见的事实，但不一定有数据支持。

2. 例如，表亲婚姻的想法，用科学术语来说，是恶心的。

3. 首先， 表亲婚姻比你想象的要普遍得多。

4. 世界上大约 10% 的家庭由二等堂兄弟或更亲近的夫妇领导。

5. 那是超过7. 5亿人。

6. 它现在在欧洲和北美可能已经过时了，但就像箍裙和礼帽一样，
表亲婚姻过去更为普遍。

7. 像查尔斯·达尔文、埃德加·爱伦·坡和阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦这样的人，
都嫁给了他们的堂兄弟姐妹。

8. 富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福总统与他的第五代堂兄埃莉诺·罗斯福结婚。

9. 她甚至不必更改姓氏。

10. 一项针对数百万份家谱资料的研究得出的结论是，在 1650 年至 1850 年之间，一般人与其配偶是第四代堂兄妹。

11. 我知道我知道， 四表哥是什么鬼？

12. 好吧，这基本上意味着普通人拥有与他们的浪漫伴侣相同的高曾曾祖父母。

13. 那是为什么？好吧， 嫁给堂兄意味着在家庭中保留金钱和权力和维持你的社会关系。这也与接近度有关。


14. 如果你年轻时没有远行，你更有可能结识一个你已经认识的人，像第二个堂兄。

15. 但即使随着铁路和工业革命的兴起，表亲婚姻又过了 50 年才在西方社会过时。

16. 流动性可能是一个因素，但研究人员还认为， 女性拥有更大的自主权和更小的家庭规模，这意味着要结婚的表兄弟姐妹更少，也影响了变化。

17. 尽管它在大西洋两岸变得不那么流行了，只有在美国， 它才变得非法。

18. 南北战争之后，美国政府对监督日常生活的更多元素产生了更大的兴趣，包括结婚。

19. 美国各州不仅开始取缔跨种族婚姻但表妹婚姻也是如此。

20. 今天， 32 个州要么彻底禁止这种做法，或仅限于那些寻求遗传咨询、已超过生育年龄或不育的人。

据估计，只有不到 1% 的美国夫妻是表亲。

但广泛的违法行为， 更不用说社会耻辱，使量化变得相当困难。

如果你问人们为什么表亲结婚似乎是错误的，健康可能会出现。

对出生缺陷和遗传疾病的恐惧影响了社会规范的变化。

但在 2002 年，国家遗传咨询师协会的研究人员发现，增加的风险很小。


在一般人群中，孩子出生时出现严重并发症的风险是百分之三到四。

和一对表亲夫妇，风险增加了 1. 7 至 2. 8 个百分点。

有了这些数字，研究人员得出结论，没有生物学理由阻止堂兄弟结婚。

看， 我完全明白了。

不管你喜不喜欢你的表妹，取决于你来自哪里，这仍然是一个有点禁忌的话题。

但事实是， 我们对它的感受是由我们所生活的文化决定的，而不一定是由它是否客观危险决定的。

毕竟，如果不是表妹结婚， 你可能就不会在这里了。

There are things we accept as obvious truths that aren't necessarily backed up by data.

For example, the idea that cousin marriage is, to use a scientific term, icky.

First off, cousin marriage is way more common than you may think.

Approximately 10 percent of the world's families are headed by couples who are second cousin or closer.

That's more than 750 million people.

And it maybe wildly out of fashion in Europe and North America now, but like hoop skirts and top hats, cousin marriage used to be a much more common sight.

People like Charles Darwin, Edgar Allan Poe and Albert Einstein, all married thier first cousins.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt married his fifth cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt.

She didn't even have to change her last name.

One study looking at millions of genealogy profiles concluded that between 1650 and 1850, the average person was fourth cousins with their spouse.

spouse 配偶，和...结婚

I know, I know, what the hell is a fourth cousin?

Well, it basically means that the average person had the same great great great grandparent as their romantic partner.

So why was that?

Well, marrying a cousin meant keeping money and power within the family and maintaining your social relationships.

It was also about proximity.

If you weren't traveling far in your young life , you're more likely to end up with someone you already know, like  a second cousin.

But even with the onset of the railroad and the industrial revolution, it still took another 50 years for cousin marriage to go out of style in Western society.

Mobility may have played a factor, but researchers also think that greater autonomy for women and smaller family sizes, meaning that there were just fewer cousins to marry, also influenced the change.

Though it became much less popular on both sides of the Atlantic, it was only in the US that it became illegal.

Following the Civil War, the American government took a greater interest in overseeing more elements of daily life, including marriage.

American states began to outlaw not only interracial marriage but cousin marriage as well. 

Today, 32 states either outright ban the practice or restrict it to those who seek genetic counseling, are beyond reproductive age or are sterile.

It's estimated that less than one percent of American couples are cousins.

But the widespread illegality, not to mention the social stigma, makes quantifying it quite difficult.


stigma 耻辱

If you ask people why cousin marriage seems wrong, health might come up.

The fear of birth defects and genetic disorders has influenced the change in social norms.

norms 标准
genetic disorders  遗传疾病

But in 2002, researchers from the National Society of Genetic Counselors found that the increased risk was a minor one.

In the general population, the risk that a child will be born with serious complications is three to four percent.

With a first-cousin couple, the risk increased by 1.7 to 2.8 percentage points.

And with those figures, the researches concluded that there was no biological reason to discourage cousins from marring.

Look, I totally get it.

Whether you fancy your cousin or not, depending on where you're from, this can still be a bit of a taboo subject.

But the truth is, our feelings around it are shaped by the culture we live in and not necessarily by whether it's objectively dangerous or not.

After all, if it wasn't for cousin marriage, you probably wouldn't be here.
