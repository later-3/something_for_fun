<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The Clarkson family</mark> lived <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">in the country near Cambridge</mark>, about half a mile from the nearest village and about a mile from the river.

lived是谓语，是一个主谓+地点状语的结构，near 是介词，near Cambridge做后置定语修饰country（乡下、国家），about前面有省略it is

They had a big，old house <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">with a beautiful garden，a lot of flowers and many old trees.</mark>

with后面是介词短语做后置定语，翻译为有，介词短语长，是因为这里有三个介词宾语并列

One Thursday morning in July, Jackie came in from the garden. She was a tall, fat woman, thirty years old. It was the hottest day of the year, but she wore a warm brown skirt and yellow shirt. She went into the kitchen to get a drink of water.

a drink of = a cup of 

Just then the phone rang. 'Cambridge 1379', Jackie said. 'Hello. This is Diane. I want to talk to Mother.'
'Mother isn't here', 'Jackie said.' <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">She's at the doctor's</mark>'
'Why? What's wrong?'

Just then 就在那个时候

'Nothing is wrong,' Jackie said. 'Why are you telephoning? You are going to come this weekend? Mother wants everyone to be here.'

everyone 是代词， to be here是做宾补

’Yes, I want to come, ’Diane said. 'I'm phoning because I have no money for the train ticket.'

I want to come. 主谓宾结构, for the train ticket是做定语用的， 修饰money

‘No money! Mother is always giving you money!’

‘This phone call is very expensive，’Diane said coldly. 'Tell mother please. I need the money.'

phone call 当成复合名词，the money特指买车票的钱  

Jackie put the phone down. She took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke.

down是宾补，put需要加宾补
from her bag 介词短语做状语
and 后面是并列省略了主语

She felt angry beacuse her sister always asked for money. Diane was twenty years old, the youngest in the family. She lived in London, in one room of a big house.

She wanted to be a singer. She sang very well but she could never get work.

Jackie went back into the kitchen and began to make some sandwiches. Just then the back door opened, and her mother came in.


'It's very hot!' Molly said. She took off her hat and put it down on the table. She was a tall, dark woman with beautiful eyes.


Two big, black dogs came into the kitchen after her and ran across to her. She sat down and put her hands on their heads.

Jackie put the sandwiches on the table. 'Mother,' she said, 'Diane phoned. She wants money for her train ticket.'

Molly closed her eyes for a minute. Then she stood up. 'This afternoon I want you to get the house ready for the weekend,' she said. 'Oh, and please go to the village later and get my tablets'

'Yes, Mother,' Jackie said.
Molly went to the door.
'Mother, please wait a minute,' Jackie said.'Peter Hobbs came here this morning. He's very angry with you about that letter. He lost his job, you know. Why did you write to his office? He wants to talk to you about it.'

'Well, I don't want to talk to him,'Molly said. She opened the door.

'But Mother, you dont't undersatand. He's seventeen, and it was his first job. He's very,very angry. He says...he says he's going to kill you!'

Molly did not answer. She went out of the room and closed the door.
