'Nothing is wrong,' Jackie said. 'Why are you telephoning? You are going to come this weekend? Mother wants everyone to be here.'

everyone 是代词， to be here是做宾补

’Yes, I want to come, ’Diane said. 'I'm phoning because I have no money for the train ticket.'

I want to come. 主谓宾结构, for the train ticket是做定语用的， 修饰money

‘No money! Mother is always giving you money!’

‘This phone call is very expensive，’Diane said coldly. 'Tell mother please. I need the money.'

phone call 当成复合名词，the money特指买车票的钱  

Jackie put the phone down. She took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke.

down是宾补，put需要加宾补

Two big, black dogs came into the kitchen after her and ran across to her. She sat down and put her hands on their heads.

Jackie put the sandwiches on the table. 'Mother,' she said, 'Diane phoned. She wants money for her train ticket.'

Molly closed her eyes for a minute. Then she stood up. 'This afternoon I want you to get the house ready for the weekend,' she said. 'Oh, and please go to the village later and get my tablets'
