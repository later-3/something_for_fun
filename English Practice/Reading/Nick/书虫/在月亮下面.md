Five hundred kilometres <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">over</mark> Europe, Ship OM-45 moved north. In a room at the back of the ship, Kiah watched the numbers on the computer in front of him.

â€˜Time for dinner,' Rilla said.
The numbers changed quickly and Kiah's eyes didn't move. Rilla went across the room to his table. She began to watch the numbers, too.

'What't wrong with the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">satellite</mark>?' she asked. She was a beautiful girl, about twenty years old, with long black hair and big eyes.

'Nothing's wrong with the satellite,' Kiah answered quietly. 'It's the AOL.' He began to write the numbers in the book on his table.

Suddenly, the numbers stopped changing. Kiah looked at Rilla. 'Over Europe,' he said. 'It's happening. The AOL is breaking up. There are big holes in the AOL and they're getting bigger.'
