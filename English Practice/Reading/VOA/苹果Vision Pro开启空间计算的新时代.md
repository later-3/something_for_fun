科技公司苹果的新电脑设备Vision Pro头显上周开始在商店出售。

该设备使用了已推出多年的增强现实技术。

但苹果称这项技术为“空间计算”。这个装置戴在头上，遮住眼睛。

苹果公司希望Vision Pro能像2007年推出的iPhone手机一样受欢迎。

苹果公司首席执行官蒂姆·库克在谈到Vision Pro时说：“我们迫不及待地想让人们体验这一神奇的产品。”

Vision Pro也将是苹果最昂贵的产品之一，售价为3500美元。

许多研究人员表示，高价意味着该公司可能会在第一年售出100万台或更少的设备。

但即使是iPhone在上市的第一年也不是非常成功。

当时苹果公司只卖出了大约400万部iPhone。

目前，该公司每年的销量超过2亿台。

如果Vision Pro获得成功，“空间计算”这个词可能会流行起来。

“空间计算”描述了物理世界和计算机的虚拟世界如何协同工作。

凯西·哈克尔说，增强现实(AR)和人工智能(AI)是帮助实现空间计算的两个计算领域。

她经营着一家为Vision Pro制作程序的新公司。

哈克尔说：“空间计算将使设备能够以前所未有的方式理解世界。”她补充说，这将会改变人类和计算机协同工作的方式。

苹果公司表示，将会有600多个新设计的程序或应用程序可以在这款头显上使用。

应用程序将包括电视网络和视频服务，尽管奈飞和谷歌的YouTube将无法使用。

其他应用程序包括视频游戏和教育服务。

Zoom和其他提供在线会议工具的公司已经为 Vision Pro开发了应用程序。

自iPhone发布以来，屏幕瘾一直在加剧， Vision Pro可能会加剧这种情况。

这还可能会使人们与现实世界分离，让他们依赖技术。

其他科技公司也在研发空间计算产品。

谷歌一直在开发一款名为Project Starline的视频会议产品。

这会让坐在不同城市的两个人感觉他们在同一个房间里。

但Starline还没有被广泛发布。

Meta多年来一直在销售Quest头显。

它可以被视为一种空间计算设备，但该公司并没有以这种方式推销它。

Vision Pro配备了高分辨率的屏幕，可以回放事件的三维视频记录，让事件看起来像是又一次发生。

苹果公司9月份发布的高价iPhone机型可以录制所谓的“空间视频”。苹果公司的头显还会对用户的手和眼睛的运动做出反应，试图让设备感觉像是身体的一部分。


佩戴该设备时，用户将能够用手四处移动，打开不同的虚拟计算机屏幕。

哈克尔说，空间计算“是一种开始适应用户的技术，而不是要求用户适应这种技术。”

“这一切都应该是非常自然的。”然而，在与他人共进晚餐时戴上头显而不是时不时地看手机是否自然还有待观察。

[00:00.36]Technology company Apple's new computing device, the Vision Pro headset, became available in stores last week.
[00:12.36]The device uses augmented reality technology which has been available for years.
[00:20.89]But Apple calls the technology "spatial computing." The device is worn on the head over the eyes.
[00:31.41]Apple hopes the Vision Pro will be as popular as the iPhone, Apple's cellphone that came out in 2007.
[00:43.00]"We can't wait for people to experience the magic," Apple chief Tim Cook said while discussing the Vision Pro.
[00:53.51]The Vision Pro will also be among Apple's most costly products at $3,500.
[01:04.03]Many researchers say the high cost means the company might sell 1 million or fewer of the devices during its first year.
[01:17.28]But even the iPhone was not extremely successful in its first year on the market.
[01:25.13]Apple only sold about 4 million iPhones back then.
[01:31.06]Now, the company sells more than 200 million of them each year.
[01:38.50]If the Vision Pro succeeds, the term "spatial computing" might become popular.
[01:46.81]"Spatial computing" describes how the physical world and the virtual world of computers can work together.
[01:57.12]Augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are two areas of computing that help make spatial computing happen, said Cathy Hackl.
[02:13.25]She runs a new company that makes programs for the Vision Pro.
[02:19.46]Hackl said, "Spatial computing will enable devices to understand the world in ways they never have been able to do before." 
[02:31.19]She added that it is going to change the way humans and computers work together.
[02:38.92]Apple says more than 600 newly designed programs, or apps, will be available to use on the headset right away.
[02:50.65]Apps will include television networks and video services although Netflix and Google's YouTube will not be available.
[03:02.13]Other apps will be for video games and educational services.
[03:08.71]Zoom and other companies that provide online meeting tools have built apps for the Vision Pro.
[03:18.37]Vision Pro may worsen screen addiction that has only grown since the iPhone was released.
[03:27.49]It also might separate people from the real world and make them dependent on the technology.
[03:36.34]Other technology companies are also working on spatial computing products.
[03:43.44]Google has been working on a video meeting product called Project Starline.
[03:51.15]It would make two people sitting in different cities feel like they are in the same room.
[03:59.28]But Starline has not been widely released.
[04:03.94]And Meta has sold the Quest headset for years.
[04:09.75]It could be considered a spatial computing device, but the company does not market it in that way.
[04:18.51]The Vision Pro comes equipped with high-resolution screens that can play back three-dimensional video recordings of events and make it seem as though the event is happening again.
[04:35.42]Apple's high-priced iPhone models released in September can record what it calls "spatial video." 
[04:45.45]Apple's headset also reacts to a user's hand and eye movements in an attempt to make the device feel like it is part of the body.
[04:58.67]While wearing the device, users will be able to use their hands to move around and open different virtual computer screens.
[05:10.55]Spatial computing "is a technology that's starting to adapt to the user instead of requiring the user adapting to the technology," Hackl said.
[05:25.13]"It's all supposed to be very natural." 
[05:29.14]However, it remains to be seen how natural it is to wear a headset while having dinner with another person instead of just looking at your phone from time to time.
