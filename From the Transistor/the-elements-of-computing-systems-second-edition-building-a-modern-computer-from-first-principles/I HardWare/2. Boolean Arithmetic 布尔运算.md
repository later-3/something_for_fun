Adder chips
all the functions performed by digital computers——not only arithmetic operations——can be reduced to adding binary numbers.Therefore, constructive understanding of binary addition holds the key to understanding many fundamental operations performed by the computer's hardware.

Fixed word size: Yet computers are finite machines that use a fixed word size for representing numbers.

`word size` is a common hardware term used for specifying the number of bits that computers use for representing a basic chunk of information——in this case, integer values.

Typically, 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit registers are used for representing integers. The fixed word size implies that there is a limit on the number of values that these registers can represent.

For example, suppose we use 8-bit registers for representing integers. This representation can code $2^8$ = 256 different tings. 

### 2.4 signed binary numbers

two's complement, also known as radix complement

In a binary system that uses a word size of n bits, the two's complement binary code that represents negative x is taken to be the code that represents $2^n - x$. For example, in a 4-bit binary system, -7 is represented using the binary code associated with $2^4 - 7=9$, which happens to be 1001. Recalling that +7 is represented by 0111, we see that $1001 + 0111 = 0000$ (ignoring the overflow bit)
