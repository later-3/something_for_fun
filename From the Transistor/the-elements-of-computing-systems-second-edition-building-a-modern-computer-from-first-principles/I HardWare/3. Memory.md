In this chapter we introduce and build `sequential` chips.

Needless to say, the notions of current and previous go hand in hand with the notion of time: you remember now what was committed to memory before.

This can be done using a clock that generates an ongoing train of binary signals that we call tick and tock. The time between the beginning of a tick and the end of the
subsequent tock is called a cycle, and these cycles will be used to regulate the operations of all the memory chips used by the computer.

Computer programs use variables, arrays, and objects——abstractions that persist data over time. Hardware platforms support this ability by offering memory devices that know how to maintain state.

We will approach this challenge by introducing a clock and an elementary, time-dependent logic gate that can flip and flop between two stable states: representing 0 and representing 1. This gate, called data flip-flop(DFF), is the fundamental building block from which all memory devices will be built. In spite of its central role, though, the DFF is a low-profile, inconspicuous gate: unlike registers, RAM devices, and counters, which play prominent roles in computer architectures, DFFs are used implicitly, as low-level chip-parts embedded deep within other memory devices.
