familiar with HDL and hardware simulation, we are ready to get our hands dirty and actually go and develop some chips.

Before we go on, let us remind ourself, what is the general spirit of this course?

# Project 1
Given：Nand
Goal：build the following gates:

## Elementary logic gates
- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux

## 16-bit variants
- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16

## Multi-way variants
- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way

# Multiplexor

# Example: using mux logic to build a programmable gate
