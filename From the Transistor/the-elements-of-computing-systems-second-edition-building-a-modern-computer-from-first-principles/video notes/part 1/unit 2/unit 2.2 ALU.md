# The Arithmetic logic unit

the ALU computes a function on the two inputs, and outputs the result

f: one out of a family of pre-defined arithmetic and logical functions

# The Hack ALU
- operates on two 16-bit, two's complement values 
- outputs a 16 bit, two's complement value
- which function to compute is set by six 1-bit inputs
- computes one out of a family of 18 functions
- also outputs two 1-bit values
